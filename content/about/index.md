## About Me

ðŸ‘‹Â Hi, Iâ€™m Chris - I am a big fan of Microsoft Cloud Security products because there my two favorite topics Identity and Security work together in a unique way. I've been working in IT for quite a while and have almost 15 years of experience in IT security in various roles. At the moment I am a Cybersecurity Architect at glueckkanja AG and help our customers with my favorite topics. I am 43 years old and live with my family in Hamburg.
