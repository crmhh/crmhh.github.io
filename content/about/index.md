## About Me

ðŸ‘‹Â Hi, Iâ€™m Chris - I am a big fan of Microsoft Cloud Security products because there my two favorite topics Identity and Security work together in a unique way. I've been working in IT for quite a while and have almost 15 years of experience in IT security in various roles. At the moment I am a Cybersecurity Architect at glueckkanja AG and help our customers with my favorite topics. I am 44 years old and live with my family in Hamburg.

In January 2025, I was also [awarded Microsoft MVP](https://mvp.microsoft.com/en-US/MVP/profile/cad9c18c-40fe-475d-b9d9-dbec9bce58c3) in the Security category and the Identity & Access Management technology area.

## Other Blogs / Publications

This is not my first blog. Until summer 2024 I've used to blog on Medium. Currently I'm not sure how much of the content I will migrate to this blog. Have a look - there are some nice articles: https://chris-brumm.medium.com/

Over time I reviewed some articles in the [Microsoft Entra ID - Attack and Defense Playbook](https://github.com/Cloud-Architekt/AzureAD-Attack-Defense) and in July 2024 I've added there an appendix about [How to prevent lateral movement to Entra ID when your Active Directory has fallen](https://github.com/Cloud-Architekt/AzureAD-Attack-Defense/blob/main/LateralMovementADEID.md) 

And you will find articles from me on the [blog of glueckkanja AG](https://www.glueckkanja.com/en/authors/christopher-brumm/)
